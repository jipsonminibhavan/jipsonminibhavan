# Hi there, nice to meet you, I'm Jipson !👋

Currently, I'm learning coding. I'm thrilled to learn new and challenging things !✨

I grew up in two cultures: both the Indian and the German culture have shaped me equally. 
I have learned to be open to new situations, to recognize the subtle nuances of different cultures and to adapt to them. 
That means: All my life I have transcribed between Indian culture and German culture, which is only possible if lifelong learning is understood as growth. As a chemical technician, I worked in a three-shift system and developed soft skills such as teamwork.
The basics of chemistry and physics has enriched me with regard to the implementation of abstract methodology in practical methods.
